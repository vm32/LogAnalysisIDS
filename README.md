### Log Analysis and Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

#### Overview
This project implements a Log Analysis and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in Java. It collects logs from various sources, parses them, detects suspicious activities based on predefined rules, and alerts administrators via email.

#### Features
- **Log Collection:** Collects logs from local files, directories, and network sources.
- **Log Parsing:** Parses log entries into structured data.
- **Rule-Based Detection:** Implements customizable rules to detect suspicious activities.
- **Alerting:** Alerts administrators via email when suspicious activities are detected.
- **Configuration:** Uses properties files for flexible configuration of log sources and alerting settings.
- **Multithreading:** Uses multithreading for efficient log collection from multiple sources simultaneously.
- **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling and logging to manage exceptions during log collection and alerting.

#### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vm32/LogAnalysisIDS
   cd repository

# Replace with your build tool commands (e.g., Maven, Gradle)
mvn clean install

## Configure log sources:
Edit `logcollector.properties` to specify files, directories, and network sources to collect logs from.

## Configure alerting:
Edit `alerting.properties` to configure email alerting settings (SMTP server, recipient, etc.).

## Run the application:
```bash
java -jar LogAnalysisIDS.jar
```

### Conclusion

This Log Analysis and IDS project provides a scalable and efficient solution for monitoring and detecting potential security threats in log data. By leveraging Java's multithreading capabilities and configurable rule-based detection, it offers a robust framework for enhancing cybersecurity measures within organizations.
